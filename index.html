									<p>This is a professional ePortfolio to showcase my work throughout my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University. <br />

										In the navigation above, you can find my Self-Assessment, Code Review, and detailed narratives for each of the three categories 
										(Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures; and Databases). <br />
										Every narrative closely introduces its artifact along with explaining both the original and enhanced functionality. Separate repository
										links to both the original artifact code and enhanced artifact code can be located within the individual category pages as well.
									</p>
								
									<p>This ePortfolio was created by selecting artifacts that best aligned with each category's directive. I chose my artifacts and 
										started workig on enhancement plans for each of them. At that point in the process I also recorded my code review. The code review 
										covers both artifacts (one artifact for the category Software Design and Engineering, and one full stack artifact that
										represents both Algorithms and Data Structures; and Databases). After the detailed analysis of both artifacts, I worked on the actual enhancements
										and their individual narratives. In this ePortofolio, I am showcasing the final polished versions of both artifacts and their three narratives.
