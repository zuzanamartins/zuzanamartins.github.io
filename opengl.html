	<p>This is a project to showcase my skills and knowledge of Software Design and Engineering.</p>

	<p>	The artifact that I am using for the category Software Design/Engineering is one I created for one of my previous classes, CS-330 Computer Graphic and Visualization. The project was created in February 2021. I built this artifact from an open-source code that came from the website Learn OpenGL <a href="www/learnopengl.com">Learn OpenGL</a>. The goal of the project was to recreate a real-life image that contained four individual objects. I chose to recreate a simple scene containing four items placed on a table: a toy house (created by connecting a pyramid and a cube), a bowl (two cylinders), a mirror (two elongated cubes) and a plane, that the objects are set on. The animation has lighting and a movable camera view, so I can view it from any angle and distance. <br />
		I chose this project because it was one that I devoted a lot of time and effort into. I believe that it shows well that not only do I have a good grasp of C++, but that I also understand the basics of OpenGL and am able to manipulate them to create my project. OpenGL objects are built using matrices, so that is another component that showcases my ability to use math and logic to create the structures. While most of my objects are built using predetermined vertices to draw triangles, one of the objects, the bowl, is created by using cylinders. Cylinders are objects that are sourced from their own header file, so by including them in my scene, I am also displaying the ability to use objects that have their own classes. <br />
		My planned enhancement was to clean up and rework the massive source code into a smaller file that would load more efficiently. Throughout the research, I learned that there is no actual way of simply just compressing my object coordinates; however I could instead create meshes and use models, which would leave me with a very small source file that would outsource a lot of the code into other classes. This can be accomplished by using Assimp â€“ Open Asset Import Library. With Assimp I believe I will be able to not only bring my project up to industry standards, but also improve the look of my objects; make them more life-like.   <br />
		So far, I have cleaned up the code and added proper documentation to it, but I am still working on integrating Assimp. I have faced serious challenges getting the project off the ground due to my working environment. The artifact was originally created in the virtual environment that was provided to me by the school, however, I no longer have access to that. It soon became obvious that neither my MacBook, nor my older Windows computer would be able to run the necessary programs, so I had to purchase a new machine. I do finally have everything up and running for the artifact in its current state. So as of right now, I am researching Assimp and modifying my environment for the planned enhancements.
