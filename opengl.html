	<h3>This is a project to showcase my skills and knowledge of Software Design and Engineering.</h3>

		<dt>Identification</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>This artifact used for the category Software Design/Engineering is one that was created for the class CS-330 Computer Graphic and Visualization. The project was created in February 2021. This artifact was built from an open-source code that came from the website <a href="www.learnopengl.com">Learn OpenGL</a>. The goal of the project was to recreate a real-life image that contained a few various individual objects. I chose to recreate a simple scene containing items placed on a table: a toy house (created by connecting a pyramid and a cube), a bowl (two cylinders), a mirror (two elongated cubes) and a plane, that the objects are set on. The animation has lighting and a movable camera view, so the user can move the camera’s point of view around. </p>

		<dt>Overview</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>I chose this project because it was one that I devoted a lot of time and effort into. I believe that it shows that not only do I have a good grasp of C++, but that I also understand the basics of OpenGL and am able to manipulate them to create my vision. My chosen OpenGL objects are built using matrices, so that is another component that showcases my ability to use math and logic to create the structures. These objects are all compiled by using predetermined coordinates (vertices) and drawn as triangle arrays. </p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Justification</dt>
		<dd>		
			<p>For this project, I made multiple modifications and enhancements that not only improved functionality and flow of the code, but also added an additional, complex object. This new object – a bowl, was created using cylinders. Cylinders are created differently from the ones already present in the original project. They are objects that are sourced from their own header file, thus by including them in my modifications, I am also displaying the ability to use objects that have their own classes. </p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Explanation</dt>
		<dd>	
			<p>I streamlined texture loading by using a utility, rather than having multiple blocks of texture loading code. This considerably reduced size of the source code and allowed for a far larger number of textures to be used within the project. <br />
		I also improved the overall functionality and flow of the source code by changing the project’s shaders to ones that were better suited for this scene. These new shaders allowed me to utilize multiple lighting sources, rather than relying on just two unnatural looking lamp objects. I modified keyboard input so it would perform well with my new shaders. The keyboard input allows for simple up, down, left, right, but also forward and backwards movements. I further enhanced the project by adding mouse input for both cursor and scroll. This allows the user to simply use their mouse to change where the camera is looking; and scroll to zoom in or out of the scene. </p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Final Discussion</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>I have faced serious challenges getting the original project off the ground due to my working environment. The artifact was originally created in the virtual environment that was provided to me by the school, however, I no longer had access to that. Setting up the environment took a considerate amount of time, however once I was able to accomplish that, I quickly moved onto my planned modifications and enhancements. At the beginning of the process, I had a fair idea of what the project needed in order to elevate it (new shaders, better lighting, and additional objects), however as I worked my way through it, I realized I had an opportunity to make improvements that would give my project a much more streamlined, industry-standard design. Using the texture utility and adding mouse functionality were exactly that.</p>
