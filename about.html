	<h1>Professional <br />
	Self-Assessment</h1>
</header>




<p>This professional self-assessment is part of my ePortfolio that is showcasing my polished CS-499 Computer Science Capstone work, and is also a summary of my two years long experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. </p>
<p>I joined the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University in summer 2019. As I have previously obtained all my general requirements and electives by earning an associate degree in Psychology, I immediately started taking Computer Science, Information Technology, and higher-level math courses. Throughout the first few months, I was introduced to higher-level programming languages such as Python, Java and C++. Each was introduced in its own class, and I had the opportunity to learn the basics of each, along with creating some small projects. I have also taken classes that were focused on working with databases. I learned SQL and experienced working with a database through a command line/terminal.</p>
<p>Among the most impactful courses was CS-330 Computer Graphic and Visualization. That class further expanded my knowledge of C++ and introduced me to OpenGL. I discovered how to transform lines of code into actual animations. Another greatly important course was CS-340 Client/Server Development. This was the very first time I was taught how to create a full-stack project. I’ve learned even more about databases, this time focused on MongoDB, and in the later part of the course, we worked with Python and Jupyter Notebook to create a user interface that would connect to our database and bring it to life. </p>
<p>Outside of learning new programming languages, I also had the opportunity to study and write code for embedded systems using C#. I was able to connect a little board to my computer and write code that would then turn its light sensors on in predetermined intervals. This experience was very neat, seeing how my code can directly affect the item I was holding in my hand. Another greatly enjoyable class taught me mobile app development. While most of the course was focused on designing the user interface, I was absolutely fascinated. Both Android Studio for Android apps and Xcode for Apple’s iOS apps make the designing process seem quite seamless. Throughout those eight weeks, I concluded that mobile app development is something I am very passionate about. Designing user interfaces for both mobile apps, and currently my ePortfolio, has been a task that I very much enjoyed and gave it my all. Looking many years back, designing web sites was what originally interested me in the computer science field. </p>
<p>The program gave me solid information not only when it comes to learning programming languages, but I was also able to learn about development lifecycle and various project management approaches, such as Agile. I find the Agile approach particularly friendly to both customers and developers, because “it helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches” (Atlassian, 2021, para. 1). It follows a plan and code is done in small increments (the so-called stories and epics) that are more manageable and more frequently reviewed and incorporated. </p>
<p>Learning about Agile allowed me to understand how collaborating in a team environment can work. I have learned that communication is extremely important, especially when it comes to teams that simultaneously work on the same projects. Frequent updates and open communication is extremely important as without those, the project would end in chaos. Large infrequent code updates can and usually will cause merging and functionality issues. I personally experienced this in one of my classes, when the entire class pushed their code additions to the repository holding the actual project, and there was absolutely no communication prior to that. That said, as an online student, my experience collaborating with others academically was fairly limited to perhaps a couple of courses. Most of my knowledge of the how and why comes from learning about it in textbooks and through lectures. </p>
<p>Communication skills are very important in the big scheme of things. Knowing how to explain technical issues and ideas to clients who may have no technical knowledge, is essential. When speaking to other students or people with no programming background about complex issues, I have learned to break those technical details down into easily understandable explanations. Such skill also demonstrates that I understand the subject at hand in depth. I have shown this skill many times academically throughout my time at SNHU, both in written assignments and through discussion posts.</p>
<p>Communication in a professional setting starts as soon as a new project comes on board. Figuring out the client’s requirements along with any potential additional wants is the very beginning of each project’s journey. It is important to discuss it in detail to ensure both the client and the developer are on the same page with their vision. There is always the chance of some of the project’s requirements changing, so communication lines should stay open between the client and the project owner. While remote and virtual ways of communicating are still beneficial and better than no communication at all, in the above mentioned “Agile software development depends on public communication channels to facilitate the diffusion of ideas throughout the entire team. In the office, everyone is aware of spoken conversations as well as being free to examine the whiteboard” (Soroker, 2021, para.11). This especially important because in the modern times, when so much work has been remote, many developers have to find other ways to keep up with their team members work.</p>
<p>Learning about data structures and algorithms was part of nearly every course that taught me a new programming language. I was able to learn about what the most common structures are, and how to use their algorithms to further handle that data. In the higher-level languages that I have learned, such as Python, Java, C#, and C++, we are often working with structures that already have their predetermined algorithms. That said, experimenting and learning of different ways that we can handle our data structures was a great way to increase knowledge as well. It broadens what we think we know and increases our understanding. Being able to figure out and explain how a complex idea can be simplified or done differently, is the greatest tool for learning. </p>
<p>The program focuses greatly on software engineering. It was the one aspect that connected many of my classes. SNHU introduces us to a variety of languages, and I quickly learned that mastering one does in fact make it a bit easier to understand the others. Learning how to use documentation and read code taught me that I can figure out how a program operates without needing to see it run. I found this skill especially important when I was able to effectively use the documentation to figure out my embedded system code in CS 350 – Emerging Systems Architecture & Technologies. </p>
<p>When I took CS 410 – Software Reverse Engineering, I gained a whole new level of understanding. Deconstructing higher level programming languages to assembly and then back allowed me to really study the basic and see just how exactly a computer makes sense of the code we write. Reverse engineering was truly eye-opening experience for me, because it also allowed me to further explore security and what kind of a place that reverse engineering currently hold in the real world.</p>
<p>Throughout my time in the program, I was exposed to couple of database infrastructures. The first being MySQL though DAT 220 – Intro to Databases. I studied the basic commands and learned how to manipulate, search, and maintain my database. In the Client/Server course, the infrastructure we worked with was MongoDB. There were many similarities when it came to handling and commands, but I was especially impressed by how well-maintained MongoDB’s documentation is. It made learning much less complicated. I was able to take MongoDB much further than MySQL, when I connected to a Python CRUD bridge and then to a Jupyter dashboard. It allowed me to see how databases can be used in real life and just how I can handle them. </p>
<p>My academic experience with security centers around CS 405 – Secure Coding course, in which I learned in detail the most common ways a malicious user can attack our software and many ways through which I can discover, address, and prevent potential vulnerabilities. For example, SQL injections of unwanted data into a database or a buffer overflow are among the most common security attack. In addition to learning about security techniques, I was able to create a complete security policy for a fictional company. I was able to put together a proposal that included complex security recommendations for the company’s system, but also their developers. I addressed secure coding standards, security principles, encryption policies and defense in depth. I addressed the company’s testing practices and pointed out during which stages in the pre-production and production full circle pipeline testing should be conducted. I specifically spoke about unit testing and how that should be conducted regularly and frequently during development. Unit testing allows us to ensure the blocks of our code are working as intended. It will help catch errors, display warnings and messages early on in the process, before those flaws can cause actual damage.</p>
<p>Secure coding should always be kept in mind. We need to be aware of any potential vulnerabilities our code may have. Keeping up with current trends that hackers and malicious users are using is highly recommended. On that same note, it is important to also always remember that sensitive information (such as personal information or payment details) should be prioritized when it comes to creating updates and security patches. </p>

<h2>Introduction to Artifacts</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This ePortfolio was created by selecting artifacts that best aligned with each category's directive, and that I wanted to use to showcase my skills and knowledge on. My artifact for Software Design and Engineering is an OpenGL project and I found it to be an excellent choice to not only delve deeper into software design, but to also showcase my ability to handle complex code structures. This artifact required a solid knowledge of C++, but also the ability to set up and use OpenGL. During the stage in which I worked on enhancing my artifact, I not only increased the complexity of my project, but also streamlined large portions of the code. This resulted in better looking environment, and a much neater code that was more up to industry standards. </p>
<p>For my other artifact, I chose a full stack project through which I can show my skills and knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. This artifact is a user-friendly interface that provides access to a MongoDB database. Specifically, we have a database of shelter animals, and the user interface (or dashboard) allows us to easily search and view the database. For the database portion of this capstone project, I focused on creating the database and its collections: one for the data, and one for authentications and permissions. I did also use complex MongoDB queries within the dashboard’s code. The data table that displays the data in rows and columns, also gives users the ability to simply click a radio button and have the data table populate with pre-determined results of those complex search queries. </p>
<p>The user-interface itself is created of two files. In the first one, Python CRUD module (create, read, update, delete) I can show that I have a great grasp of the Python data structures and understand just what such a ‘simple’ class can do when connected to a dashboard. Through the dashboard’s algorithms, I can use the CRUD module to pull data from my database and display it not only on the data table, but also on few additional widgets that all update as the data table’s output does. </p>
<p>The two artifacts together show that I have a well-rounded knowledge of all three categories. I have shown that I can build a full stack application, but also have the necessary skills to design and build software. This demonstrates that I hold a range of skills that work well together when it comes to both designing and creating projects that vary from computer graphics to full-stack application.</p>
