<p>The above embedded code review will introduce you to my OpenGL and Jupyter Projects. This code review was recorded before any enhancements or modifications took place.</p>
<p>I provided a thorought walkthrough through both projects, discussing the existing functionality. The code review also contains detailed code analysis in which I addressed
code structure, documentation and comments, and also any issues it currently contained. </p>
<p>Finally, I explained my plans for enhancements and fixes. </p>
