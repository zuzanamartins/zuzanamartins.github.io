	<h3>This is the continuation of the full stack project I introduced in Jupyter Project - Structures. This second part focuses on my skills with Databases.</h3>

		<dt>Identification of the artifact</dt>
		<dd>
		<p>The artifact that I chose for the third category, Databases, was created for the class CS-340 Client/Server Development. The class was taken in February of 2021. The course material introduced full stack development. 
			The artifact that I chose is used to cover two categories: Algorithms/Data Structures and Databases, and for the Databases enhancement category, the back end of the project will be the focus. As previously mentioned, 
			this project is a combination of two parts: the MongoDB database that is the topic of this category, and a Jupyter Notebook dashboard that acts as the user interface to the database. The user interface displays what 
			are in fact MongoDB query results connected to the database through a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) class. The dashboard then takes those results and displays them through a variety of widgets. The Mongo queries allow for very specific and multifaceted search queries to be shown on a very user-friendly interface. <br />
			I selected this project not only because it is a full-stack artifact, and thus allows me to use a wide range of skills, but also because I found it quite challenging to both create, and further enhance. 
			It gave me the chance to build something from the ground up and see my database come alive through a customizable user interface that even someone with no computer science background could easily use.

		<dt>Overview of original functionality</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The artifact itself is made of three files, a python CRUD (create, read, update, delete) class, Jupyter Notebook file and a comma-separated values text file The third category focuses on databases; thus the focus in this enhancement plan is on the MongoDB database, and in no small part also the Jupyter notebook file. <br />
				The MongoDB database processes the comma-separated value into its own database and collection. To provide some basic search functions for functionality testing, I created a couple of simple index queries. The MongoDB database also holds the authentication data. It contains a separate collection that holds two different user authentications. A read only account, and a full access admin account. Both are password protected. The Jupyter notebook contains a few blocks of Mongo queries meant to return specific results to the data table. However, in the original project file, they do not function.</p>
